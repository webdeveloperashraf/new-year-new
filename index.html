        <h1>Description of Webdeveloper </h1>
        <p> <strong>
            Web developers build websites: they use code to achieve the right functionality and aesthetic look. Software engineers build programs, software and applications, and are less involved with customer-facing sites.
        </p> </strong>
    <p>1. <strong>Programmer vs. Developer </strong> - These terms are one and the same. Whether you have Programmer or Developer on your business card.
      <br>
    2. <strong>Front End Engineer </strong>- “Front end” includes all customer-facing features of a website or app: text fields, images, buttons and banners. These engineers program the interface users engage with. HTML, JavaScript are all front end coding languages.
   <br>
   3. <strong>Back End Engineer</strong> - Back end engineers build the mechanics of how a site processes information. They determine how the site will communicate with servers, and how to collect, store and manage user data. 
<br>
   4. <strong>Full Stack Engineer</strong> - If you know multiple languages and have successfully built both front and back ends of a site, congrats: you’re a full stack engineer. 
<br>
   5. <strong>Software Architect</strong> - An experienced programmer who leads the development team. They make high-level decisions about design and functionality.
